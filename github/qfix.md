# Claude Command: Quick Fix (qfix)

This command provides an intelligent GitHub issue-to-solution workflow with **mandatory user approval for every step**. No action is taken without explicit user confirmation.

## Usage

To fix an issue, use the issue number:
```
/qfix #5
```

Or with hash symbol:
```
/qfix 12
```

## What This Command Does

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Every step requires explicit user approval before execution!**

1. **Issue Analysis**:
   - Fetches the complete issue details including title, description, and all comments
   - Analyzes the problem context and requirements
   - Identifies any referenced files, components, or dependencies
   - **‚Üí Waits for user confirmation to proceed**

2. **Branch Creation** (MANDATORY - IMMEDIATE):
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to create new branch**
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Creates a NEW branch IMMEDIATELY - NEVER works on main/master!**
   - Uses `gh issue develop {issue-number} --name fix/issue-{number}-{short-description} --checkout`
   - Automatically creates and links branch to the GitHub issue
   - Switches to the new branch for development
   - **‚Üí Verifies we're on the new branch before proceeding**

3. **Solution Planning**:
   - Creates a detailed implementation plan based on the issue content
   - Considers existing codebase patterns and architecture
   - Provides step-by-step breakdown of required changes
   - Estimates complexity and potential risks
   - **‚Üí Waits for user approval of the plan**

4. **Plan Review & GitHub Comment**:
   - Presents the final plan for review
   - Allows modifications and refinements
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to post plan as comment on GitHub issue**
   - Posts the approved plan as a comment on the GitHub issue only after approval
   - Links the plan to the issue for future reference

5. **Implementation** (Step-by-step with approvals):
   - **‚Üí Before each implementation step: Asks for permission**
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Verifies we're on the correct feature branch before ANY code changes**
   - Executes one plan step at a time
   - Shows proposed changes before making them
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER starts/stops/restarts servers - user handles server management**
   - **‚Üí After implementation: Waits for user testing and feedback**
   - **‚Üí Only proceeds to commit after user confirms implementation is working**
   - Makes incremental commits for each logical change
   - Follows existing code patterns and conventions
   - **‚Üí After each step: Asks to continue or pause**

6. **Quality Assurance**:
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to run linting and formatting checks**
   - Runs linting and formatting checks
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to execute tests**
   - Executes relevant tests
   - Validates the fix addresses the original issue
   - Ensures no regressions are introduced

7. **Completion & Merge**:
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to create pull request**
   - Creates a pull request with detailed description
   - References the original issue with closing keywords
   - **‚Üí Explicitly waits for your testing confirmation**
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to merge PR**
   - Merges the PR using appropriate merge strategy
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to post solution summary to issue**
   - Posts a comprehensive solution summary comment on the original issue
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to post feature update summary**
   - Posts a user-friendly feature update comment explaining new functionality and how it works
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to clean up feature branch**
   - Cleans up the feature branch
   - **‚Üí Asks permission to switch to main and pull latest changes**
   - Switches to main branch and pulls latest changes from remote

## Branch Naming Convention

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always creates NEW branches - never works on main/master!**

Branches are automatically named following this pattern:
- `fix/issue-{number}-{short-description}`
- Example: `fix/issue-5-memory-leak-in-parser`
- Example: `fix/issue-12-authentication-timeout`

**Branch Creation is MANDATORY:**
- **NEVER work directly on main/master branches**
- **ALWAYS create a new feature branch for every issue**
- **MUST link the branch to the GitHub issue**
- **MUST switch to the new branch before any code changes**
- **NEVER starts/stops/restarts servers - user handles server management**

## Commit Message Format

All commits follow conventional commit format with issue reference:
- `fix: resolve memory leak in parser component (#5)`
- `feat: add authentication timeout handling (#12)`
- `test: add unit tests for issue #5 fix`
- `docs: update documentation for issue #12 changes`

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER adds Claude as Co-Author in commit messages!**

## Pull Request Integration

The command automatically:
- Creates descriptive PR titles: `Fix: Memory leak in parser component (#5)`
- Generates comprehensive PR descriptions including:
  - Link to the original issue
  - Summary of changes made
  - Testing instructions
  - Breaking changes (if any)
- Uses closing keywords: `Closes #5`, `Fixes #12`, `Resolves #15`
- **Feature Update Comments**: Posts user-friendly explanation of new functionality without code details

7. **Issue Linking**: Proper GitHub issue linking for traceability
8. **üö® MANDATORY BRANCH CREATION**: **NEVER works on main/master - ALWAYS creates new branches**
9. **Server Management**: **NEVER starts/stops/restarts servers - user handles server management**
10. **Solution Documentation**: Posts comprehensive solution summary to original issue after merge
11. **Feature Communication**: Posts user-friendly feature update explaining new functionality without code details

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **"Issue not found"**: Verify issue number and repository access
- **"No GitHub remote"**: Ensure repository has GitHub remote configured
- **"Permission denied"**: Check GitHub CLI authentication with `gh auth status` (should show [YOUR_USERNAME])
- **"Merge conflicts"**: Command will pause and guide through resolution
- **"Tests failing"**: Review test output and fix issues before continuing

This command streamlines the entire issue-to-solution workflow while maintaining high code quality and following Git best practices.
